% Constructs A - discrete matrix representation of a non-polymonial
% operator in 2D
%
% Inputs:
% 1) N   - polynomial order of Chebyshev discretization polynomial
% 2) no - number of non-spatially varying (finite-dimensional) states related through the
% operator Rop
% 3) Rop -  non-polynomial matrix operator 
% 4) p - scalar (non-polynomial) - a "degree of smoothness" vector
% 5) gridall - cell array of size dmax containing physical grid for all states
% depending on their degree of differentiability; dmax corresponds to the
% maximum degree of differentiability among all the states
%  gridall.x - grids in x direction
%  gridall.y - grids in y direction
%
%
% Outputs:
% A - block of a discrete matrix that represents a Chebyshev
% discretizaiton of the polynomial matrix operator. Represents a block of a
% square total matrix operator for PIE solution
