Major Updates:

- Addition of dpvar class: 
--- opvar class to dopvar class which is a class of opvar objects with dpvar components. 
--- All methods/functions are now overloaded to handle different variations of these new classes
- Addition of sospsimplify option: This reduces the total size of the problem and thus helps in 
  reduction of total runtime.
--- sospsimplify can be initiated by using an optional argument passed to the sossolve()
- Addition of simulation tools: A solver and executive file has been included to numerically solve a PIE for 
  some given initial conditions and inputs. 
--- User can run simulations using an examples library or directly using a PIE
