NOTE: PIETOOLS 2022 is the same version as PIETOOLS 3.0 available on MATLAB toolbox repository and GitHub.
Major Updates:

1. Simplified LPI declaration and solving for Analysis, Control and Estimation 
-- PIETOOLS 2022 has added wrapper functions to simplify and generalize the workflow for different classes of 
   systems, such as, `lpisolve()' for all the executives, `lpisettings()' for all the optimization parameters,
   and `initialize()' & `convert()' for defining PIEs.

2. New input formats
-- PIETOOLS 2022 introduces two new input formats `terms' format and `command-line parser' format. 
-- The new terms format overrides the old terms format (which is no longer supported) and uses Matlab structures with fields 
   vastly different from previous terms format. 
-- The parser format (along with the GUI for PDEs) is one of the easiest formats that can be used to define PDEs
   in one spatial dimension and systems with delays. Parser format involves predefining variables (state-class objects) and
   manipulating these variables, symbolically, to define a dynamical system. 
Please refer to the manual for details on the new terms format and parser format.

3. Support for 2D PDEs
-- PIETOOLS now supports analysis and control of PDE systems with 2 spatial variables. As such, the workflow
   to define such a PDE and solve an analysis problem is identical to that of time-delay systems and PDE systems
   with one spatial dimensions. Defining 2D PDEs is only possible through the new terms format (support for GUI and parser
   formats will be included in a later release).

4. Objects
-- PDEs and PIEs are now stored as `pde_struct' and `pie_struct' class objects. This is the first step towards making
   PIETOOLS more object-oriented and modular. Along with these class definitions, a display function has been customized
   to display the defined PDE systems in an easy-to-understand format.

5. Updates to Getting Started Demos
-- Multiple demo files have been added to demonstrate how PIETOOLS can be used to solve a variety of problems.
