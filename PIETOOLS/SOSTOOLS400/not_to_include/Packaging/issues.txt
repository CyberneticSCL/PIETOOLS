Specifying SeDuMi as required software, there is no option for the user not to install it when installing the SOSTOOLS package.
Although Matlab is able to install SeDuMi from the link, it doesn't add files to the path.
When installing the toolbox, Matlab generates an additional folder +SOSTOOLS_debug (used for reference to external files, I believe).
Matlab also generates a "resources" folder upon installation.
