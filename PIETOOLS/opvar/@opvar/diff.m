function [dP] = diff(P,invar,deg,opts)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% dP = diff(P) calculates spatial derivative of (Pu)(s) with respect to
% variable var so that d(P*u) = dP*[u;du]
% 
% INPUT 
%   P: opvar2d object
%   invar: nx1 cell or polynomial
%           - Each element invar{i} or invar(i) should correspond to a
%             a variable appearing in the opvar object
%           - If invar(i) = x^p for some power p, differentiation wrt x
%             will be performed p times
%   deg:    nx1 array of integers, defining to what order P should be
%           differentiated with respect to each variable
%   opts:   Optional inputs (see OUTPUT for details)
% 
% OUTPUT 
%   dP: composition of P with a spatial derivative wrt variable invar:
%           - dP will be such that
%             (d/d invar)*P*[u0;u1] = dP*[u0;u1;u1_x]
%           - if opts=='pure', we assume (d/d invar)*P*u does not depend on
%             any derivatives of u, and dP will be such that
%             (d/d invar)*P*[u0;u1] = dP*[u0;u1]
