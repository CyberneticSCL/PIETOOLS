function T = transl(T,I)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% [Pcat] = transl(T,[c,d]) takes in a 4-PI operator T that acts on
% functions in the interval [a,b] and changes it to a 4-PI operator that
% acts of functions on the interval [c,d].
%
% INPUT:
%
% T: a 4-PI operator
% [c,d]: interval, default [-1,1]
