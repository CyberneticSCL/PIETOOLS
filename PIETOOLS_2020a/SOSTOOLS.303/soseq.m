function sos = soseq(sos,symexpr)
% SOSEQ --- Add a new equality constraint f(x) = 0
%    to an SOS program 
%
% SOSP = soseq(SOSP,EXPR)
%
% SOSP is the sum of squares program.
% EXPR is the expression on the left hand side of the constraint, i.e., f(x).
%
% EXPR can be a column vector. In this case, several equality
% constraints will be added simultaneously to the sum of
% squares program.
